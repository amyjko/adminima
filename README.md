# adminima

An app for simple definition of administrative processes and change requests. Build around concepts of tasks, and the roles who are **accountable** for their outcomes, **responsible** for executing them, **consulted** on how they should be done, and **informed** that they are happening or completed (ARCI). People are attached to roles.

The technology stack is:

- SvelteKit for front-end and interfacing with serverless infrastructure
- Vercel for scalable hosting of the app and managed deployments
- Supabase for database, file storage, and passwordless authentication

At the moment, the project is not intended as a profit-making venture, but rather free infrastructure for not-for-profit organizations.
